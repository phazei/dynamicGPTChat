DynamicGPTChat: A Fun and Customizable Mobile App for ChatGPT
=============================================================

Welcome to DynamicGPTChat, a mobile app built for those who want a more enjoyable and tailored experience using ChatGPT. This app was created for fun, with the goal of providing a better mobile solution for ChatGPT users. It comes with a range of features that mostly match those found on the ChatGPT website, along with some additional customization options.


Features
-----------------------
*   Multi-threaded editable chats
*   All customizable model features
*   Prompt saving and applying
*   Direct connection to the OpenAI API (requires your own API key)


Future Plans
-----------------------

*   JSON responses for more metadata and potential API requests
*   Better compression of chat history to extend context
*   Automation?

We're always open to new ideas and suggestions from the community, and we plan to continuously expand the app's capabilities. One potential enhancement could involve enabling GPT to make its own HTTP requests through additional keys in its responses.


Open Source & Privacy
---------------------

DynamicGPTChat is the first Android app developed by its creator, who has decades of experience in software development. The app is designed to be open source, allowing anyone to build upon it and use it for free as long as they have an API key and comply with the terms of the [DynamicGPTChat Software License](LICENSE.txt). The app does not have a backend server, which means your API key is only sent directly to the OpenAI API and is never passed on to anyone else.
